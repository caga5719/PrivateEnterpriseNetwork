## Private Enterprise Network in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Description
This project is intended to replicate a real world Enterprise Office Network in Cisco Packet Tracer. At completion, this project will allow me to garner hands-on exposure to NAT, DHCP, DNS, TACACS+, VLANs, and Wireless Infrastructure in Cisco Packet Tracer. These are key topics/technologies in networking and will better prepare for taking the CCNA.

## General Network Requirements:
- 3 departments distributed across 3 floors with their own subnet and traffic isolation
- Data encryption through service password-encryption and WPA2/WPA3 encryption
- Wireless coverage access points areas are to overlap slightly to allow for constant coverage even when switching Apps

## Business Network Requirements:

- Automated IP address management for all departments
- Secure internet access via NAT/PAT
- Internal DNS for hostname resolution
- Centralized authentication for all network devices
- Department-level traffic segmentation via VLANs
- Wireless coverage for mobile devices
- Professional documentation suitable for portfolio use
- Should be able to support 150 connections simultaneously
- Gigabit Ethernet (1Gbps)

## Department Specific Network Requirements:
- 25 person sales department 
    - Network connectivity (i.e. printers)
    - file sharing via central server
    - internet access
    - wireless connectivity
- 15 person admin department
    - Network connectivity (i.e. printers)
    - file sharing via central server 
    - internet access
